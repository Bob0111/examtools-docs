## Intro:

Exam sessions will no longer be owned by a user, instead by a team. The primary purpose of a "team" in ExamTools is to own exam sessions and schedules, so there is no need to add everyone who is on your actual team to the ExamTools "team" -- it's purely an administrative entity. Teams can have a name, contact email, and website.

## Create a New Team:

Click on **Team List** on the left navigation in Exam Tools.
Click on **+Add New Team** in the middle upper area below the ExamTools page header.
**Add New Team** window should pop-up with four fields for you to define.
**Team Identifier** - Enter the call sign of the session manager, if you are not planning on having a unique team identifier.
Any single word call sign or acronym (3 to 10 char long) that can be used to uniquely identify the team.  It must start with a letter, but may contain letters, numbers, and hyphens, ex. UVARC, NT3ST-R, etc.
A team is identified on the schedule by a "team identifier" which starts with a letter, is 4-10 characters long, and can contain letters, numbers or -. Any call sign is a valid team ID, but your team ID doesn't have to be a call sign (e.g. UVARC, etc). This replaces the old Session Call Sign. 
**Team Name** - the team’s name or group associated with the team
**Contact E-mail Address** - a valid email address associated with the administrator (owner) of the team
**VEC** - Select an available VEC from the drop-down menu.  The individual setting up the team will have the option of selecting from the VECs for which they are a session manager/team lead/liaison in ExamTools.  Select all that apply to this team. 

## Team List : To edit or view teams

Click on **Manage Team** button
**Team Identifier:** used by the applicants to login and join the exam; also used in permalinks for the session and the team.
**Team Name:** displays along with the team identifier in the session listing on HamStudy
**E-mail address:** enter a valid email address for the administrator of the team
**Team Website:** enter the url (i.e. http://…) for the website for the club or group associated with this team. Leave blank if you do not have one.
**My team permissions:** (not editable and set by the owner/co-owner(?) of the session)
**Delegated Privileges:**
In order to list sessions for a given VEC one or more VEs who are at least co-owners must delegate their team lead permissions to the team. Note that sessions must still have a valid team lead assigned from the team, but anyone with Scheduling permissions may schedule sessions for any VEC for which the team has delegated permissions.
**Members:** 
Click on the **+** to add members.
Use the **Edit** icon or **Delete** icon to manage members on the list.
**Change team member permissions** will popup.
*Display call sign and license class*
**Name:** Shows the Display Name used in the VEs Profile.
**Credentials:** (view which VECs they are accredited with) A little blue winner's cup will display, if they are a team lead/session manager in ET for that VEC.
**Permissions** (select from the drop down)
Choose from *Owner, Co-owner and Schedule*
You can have one or more Owners who are co-equal -- this means that any of them can even remove the others from the team! Because of this, most teams will want to just have a single Owner who is the primary person responsible and then add others as "co-owners". A co-owner can do anything an owner can except add or remove other owners or co-owners. 
**Cancel**, if you want to discard changes or **Save** when editing is complete.
Members can see the team sessions in the **Session List** even if they have not been added to the session as a VE.
When done and if you would like to return to the team list, click the **back arrow** in the upper left corner under **Manage Team**.
